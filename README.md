# Rock Paper Scissor

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissor game built as our very first GitHub project while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created by me and my friend as a fun way to practice web development, version control, and collaboration.


## What We Learned

- Basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- How to create and share a GitHub repository
- Collaborating on code with friends
- Writing simple game logic
